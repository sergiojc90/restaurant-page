# Restaurant Page

Hi, great to see you!

This is a restaurant page created by DOM manipulation and using ES6 modules.

The main objective of the project is to use JavaScript only to create all the content of the page, although, the syles are going to be placed in a separate CSS file.

I've done this project as a part of JavaScript Fullstack curriculum of The Oding Project.

You are welcome to see the live version of the project here.
